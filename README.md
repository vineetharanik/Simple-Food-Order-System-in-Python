# Simple-Food-Order-System-in-Python
This Python script simulates a basic food ordering system. Users can order a pizza (small, medium, or large) and add toppings like pepperoni and extra cheese. Additionally, users can order burgers (small or big), fries, and cold drinks. The program calculates the total bill based on the choices and sizes selected.
